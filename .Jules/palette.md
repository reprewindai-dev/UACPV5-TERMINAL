## 2024-08-05 - Missing ARIA Labels on Icon-Only Buttons
**Learning:** Found multiple instances of icon-only buttons (like map controls and close buttons) missing `aria-label` attributes across different components, which hinders screen reader accessibility.
**Action:** Add `aria-label` to all icon-only buttons to ensure their purpose is communicated to assistive technologies.

**Learning:** Visible text labels and context aren't enough for screen readers; they need explicit associations (htmlFor/id) or aria-label attributes when isolated.
**Action:** Always link visible labels to inputs using htmlFor and id, and explicitly add aria-labels to standalone inputs or selects (e.g. search boxes, filter dropdowns).
