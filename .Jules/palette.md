## 2024-08-05 - Missing ARIA Labels on Icon-Only Buttons
**Learning:** Found multiple instances of icon-only buttons (like map controls and close buttons) missing `aria-label` attributes across different components, which hinders screen reader accessibility.
**Action:** Add `aria-label` to all icon-only buttons to ensure their purpose is communicated to assistive technologies.

## 2026-08-12 - Interactive elements accessibility
**Learning:** The bottom navigation bar in App.tsx used `div` elements with `onClick` handlers, making them inaccessible to keyboard and screen reader users.
**Action:** Replaced `div`s with `button` elements, added `role="tablist"`, `role="tab"`, `aria-selected`, and `aria-hidden="true"` on decorative SVGs. Reset default button styles in index.css to prevent visual regressions.
